Two days ago, Hacker News had a flood of news about the suicide of a 26-years-old talented man, Aaron Swartz. I don't know the man before, however I was so surprised because this is the second time I saw an event like this in Hacker News. The first time was when Steve Jobs passed away, more than a year ago.

Aaron is described as a very talented computer engineering. His spreading tragedy made me start to archive some of his blog's posts for reading later. And today, after reading one first post, I decided to investigate more about this man: *Why this intelligent guy committed suicide? What did he fighting for?*

Aaron was fighting to challenge an unfair system: he believed that public funded research should be able to easily accessed by public. However, it's the politics, and their ridiculous miscarriage of justice pushed this young man to an end.

For his "seem-to-be-innocent" action, the lawyer put him to face a fine $1 million and 35 years in prison. After for more than a year fighting, he ended his life.

Why people are so upset about this?

He's 26! People want to speak out loud one important thing: the system we are living are corrupted. People with money and power can sue you anything in law, they make the case so complex that you do not have much money to defend yourself, and finally end your life in a huge law fee. Even if you win in court, you're still *die* financially.

Aaron, who fighted for real justice, is got killed by the **offical justice**.

If you haven't known about Aaron yet, it's time to read about him. His story is very good to know. He is an American hero, he spends his lifetime to fighting for an open internet, to stop the US legislations that sensors the Internet like what China does.

So back to the reason, why I want to know more about Aaron, after reading one of his post?

It's [a post](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/tdk) about the movie The Dark Knight, which still is my most favourite movie ever. I love the psychology part of it so much that it was the first time, I went to IMDB to read its conversation's script. Just to understand it more.

Aaron's post even helps me understand the movie in a deeper level!

The article explain what Batman and Harvey Dent is fighting for? The criminals, in a corrupted system! The 2 heroes using different ways to attack the unjustice: One out of law - Batman and one by using law. However, the political system they are fighting for is corrupted, Harvey Dent lost his soul, and became Two Face.

I understand what Aaron is fighting to, the unjustice part in our system. And his story told me that, **it's not only in a movie**, like Batman, where drama and tragedy happens when people fight for justice. **In our real & very current life, there has people are fighting for justice, and tragedy is still happening.**
