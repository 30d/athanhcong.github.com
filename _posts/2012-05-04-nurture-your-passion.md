A story:

"I want to be happy, to be successful"

Your need to be passionate about something.

"Why?" Because, you need to do things well.
The only way to do thing well or even great is <strong>you love what you do</strong>.

"Okay, get it. But..."
???

"I don't feel passionate about anything. Everything is same same or normal." "Actually, there has some thing great, but you know, it's hard to get". "I think I love money, haha. But I don't know how to get it?".

<strong>Do great jobs</strong>, then <strong>money will follow you</strong>. Don't follow money.

"Well, I did have idea to do something great. I was so exciting". "However, that feeling get lost someday after. I stopped doing it". "Haiz... everything is same same again"

That's normal. Don't worry. This blog is for you.

To get back you energy.

Okay, now let's go back to your exciting moment. Still remember when you was so eager to... learn English? "Yep".

You better <strong>write your dream down</strong>. What you feel, what you want. Use your imagination!
I want to have a better job, more salary... I love to talk with them, the foreigners. I hate reading subtitle when watching movie. I want to hear the actors' voice. I want to travel...

"Oh, wait wait...! I actually want to learn Spanish now. Hehe, you know, my girl friend likes it."

That's okay. But stick with your choice.
Remember, <strong>just do a few thing, and do it really really well.</strong>

"Okay, how about my daily job? I don't like it. I don't find anything I love to do".

<em>Stop finding.</em> An old teacher said to me. <em>It's just there, commit to what you do. You will find what you love to do.</em>

So, <strong>love what you do.</strong>

<em>Everything worth doing is worth doing well.</em>

"Really?" Yep, <strong>do thing well, </strong>then you will<strong> see opportunities, </strong>and even better, you'll<strong> love it.</strong>

People who love to do Maths, because they can do it. When they solve new big challenge, they feel crazy good.

Get things done! You will feel happy.
No one can feel happy with half-work left.

"Yeah, I want to find my passion in work, hehe. How to do a good job?"

<strong>Do small things, step by step</strong>

The reason why you can not eat an elephant is because it is too big.
The solution for you to eat an elephant is to eat each part of it everyday.

You said you love to do something, but it's hard to get, right?
"Yep".

Okay, now take a paper, write down what you want to get.

Next, break it down to small thing, make it step-by-step actions. Like a to-do list.

For a conference: Find sponsors. Find a venue. Contact speakers and confirm them to speak. Arrange speakers in a schedule. Find out what supplies they need. Get supplies. Order food. Make posters. Registration for audience. Send reminder email the day before...

Remember "step - - - - - -  by  - - - - - -  step  - - - - - -  ".
Now imagine how to build a house... haha, you get it?

"Oh, sound great. But will it getting bore? You know? Five years to do something"

Haha, yep, so let's <strong>celebrate your small success</strong>.

Give you a small break, think about what you have done.

If you have a to do list, enjoy the moment when you finish one item. <del>Cross it!</del>

Say yourself: "Wow! I finished 60% of the work". "I gonna have it, haha"
We all love award, haha. Don't be rude to yourself. :D

"Hmm, what if I still stuck. I don't know what do to now"

Okie, <strong>talk about </strong>it,<strong> what you want to do</strong>. With anyone.
When you talk with some one about what you do, you will feel more passionate with it.

"Okie, I gonna tell you what I love to do now"

Great, tell me...

<strong>Whatever you want to do...</strong>
