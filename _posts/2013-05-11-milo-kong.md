This week is a crazy week for me. It's also very exciting.

This week, my friends and me started Milo Kong. If you haven't visited Milo Kong Facebook Page yet, then this is a short description: I started to sell drinks for startups at my working building: 195 Pearl's Hill Terrace. I get money for my service to deliver drinks to customer's office.

What is crazy about this? Wow, I do something very opposited with what I'm doing. It's not programming. It's not a scalable business. It's not big. It's not long term. It's not new.

I don't know where it is going to. I just do it because it's crazy, and I want to try (and thanks my friends at Intraix to keep pushing me!)

Above all, it turned out to be very very funny. Yeah, we love it!

And I also learn. I learn how it feels when you take money from customers. I learn how to charge for my work. How my 6 months hard-working in programming, haven't give me any cent yet, while a few minutes of  service, can give me a real dollar.

I learn that I think so much. Sometime, thing can be crazy. Just try.
