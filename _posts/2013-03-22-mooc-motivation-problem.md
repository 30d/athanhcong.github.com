This morning read this title: ["The dirty little secret of online learning: Students are bored and dropping out"](http://qz.com/65408/the-dirty-little-secret-of-online-learning-students-are-bored-and-dropping-out/). People are spending billion money to research Why?

I have same problem! I [learned and finished one of the first MOOC](http://kong.vn/ai-class-160k-students/). Then also, I tried to learn more following courses, but haven't finished any other.

To me, MOOC or Massive Open Online Course has motivation problem from each of its words: "Massive", "Open", "Online", "Course"

A short explanation:

Start with "Course": teaching naturally is not fun. Self-experience is more fun and memorable. If course has full of theory, it's bored. People, who learn programming, have a lot more delightful when finished building "Hello World!", than when finished learning Data Type.

"Online" is a problem. Again, online is bored. Physical offline is more engaged. Outdoor activities around campus is a lot more fun.

"Open" is a problem. Open _means_ it's up to you to learn or drop. It's free. You also can go back any time in future! Do you smell Procastination yet? One of the  first MOOC, Introduction to AI, didn't have this problem is because it's so novel. People even don't know after the course ends: is the content still available on the server?

Last, "Massive" is a problem. Massive means if you drop, no one care about you. Don't expect your teacher or classmate care that you are falling behind.

Teaching and nudging come together. Education needs to be with motivation.
