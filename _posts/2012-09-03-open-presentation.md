title: Make your presentation at an open conference
---

Open conference, like Barcamp, is an really cool space for everyone go together, based on our passion, to share our knowledge. 
With an **open** spirit, Barcampers can be creative in choosing their own way to share knowledge. 

After many Barcamps, I write down some of the ideas about varying ways to organising a session at Barcamp:

#Sharing an idea
>If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.
>*George Bernard Shaw*

An idea can come from what you are working on, what you've just learned and love... 

*A TED talk is a great way to share your idea and inspire people.*

For visual aid, it's better to prepare a clean Powerpoint or a creative [Prezi](http://www.prezi.com)


#Demo
>Seeing is believing (Trăm nghe không bằng mắt thấy)

In a demo, you **show** people how to do thing when you **tell** about it. At the end of a good demo, the audience can see the result and also have a clear idea how to make it.

You can prepare part of the demo in advance.

The hard thing is you need to keep talking when you are demoing. Don't let the silence too long.


#Telling a story
Telling stories like sharing idea, but it's more about what you experienced in your life.
You can share about what you are working on, why you are so passionate about it? Share about the ups and downs stories. What did you learn about any failure or success?
Telling your own adventure is a great way to help other inspired.


#Ask me anything (AMA)
This is an open session where people can ask speakers any questions on a topic.
The topic can be anything or any technology that you have many experience in, for example:

-   AMA about HTML and CSS
-   Q&A with Venture Investor

An AMA can be a team presentation, you can invite one or two friends to form a small discussion board about any topic.
This is a great way for a geeks meet-up, like Python or iOS groups…


#Lightning talks
Lightning talk is a short presentation. Unlike other presentation, a lightning talks lasts only a few minutes (3 - 10 mins) and we can group many talks into one normal session.

A lightning talk require you "think on your feet", you need to collect your idea quickly and group them in a logic manner.

*This is a lightning talk about "Camps" - an idea to organize open conference for any fields like EduCamp, FoodCamp, DesignCamp…*
