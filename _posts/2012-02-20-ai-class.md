Online learning is already quite popular with us. Many schools offered online course/material for free to worldwide students. <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/most-visited-courses/" target="_blank">MIT</a> and many other high education institutions in <a href="http://www.ocwconsortium.org/en/courses/ocwsites" target="_blank">OpenCourseWare Consortium </a>committed to provide free online courses. Stanford provide its <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/StanfordUniversity/videos?view=pl" target="_blank">free courses in You Tube</a> and iTunes. YouTube now becomes an easy source to access courses in various topics from Psychology to Engineering.

<a href="www.ai-class.com" target="_blank">ai-class (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence)</a> was introduced in October 2011, then quickly and widely attracted a record-breaking number of students enrolled: <strong><a href="http://robots.stanford.edu/index.html" target="_blank">160.000 from 190 countries</a>, this is more than <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/science/16stanford.html?_r=1" target="_blank">10 times larger</a> than the size of Stanford’s entire student body</strong>. People call it <a href="http://blog.dotsub.com/2011/09/05/revolutionary-stanford-ai-class-to-reach-students-speaking-170-languages-with-dotsub/" target="_blank">a revolution</a> in education.

<strong>Why ai-class have such appealing to people</strong>. This may be the result of combining of many great things:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hot topic</strong>: AI is a hard but very interesting topic, this course teaches students how to build a "brain for machine", for purpose that machines can do tasks for human, like collecting trash, guiding people in shopping/travelling, driving car automatically and safely in city...</li>
	<li><strong>Teacher</strong>: the course was taught by 2 most prominent Stanford professor/scientist in AI, Sebastian at that time is Professor of Computer Science and Director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Stanford University. Peter Norvig is Director of Research at Google Inc. It's undeniable to listen to these professors.</li>
	<li><strong>Interaction</strong>: Traditional online courses give you a series of videos which are captured in class room. You get knowledge by textbook and watching video by video passively. AI Class provides much more learning interaction. Quiz is provided in each lesson. You have to do homework assignments every week. There have mid-term and final test to grade your knowledge. You even have chance to ask professors questions.</li>
	<li><strong>Achievement</strong>: If you finish the class, you will receive a letter of accomplishment from professors.</li>
	<li>Another interesting point is that this class is held at the same time with the real AI class at Stanford. Our professors try to keep all the material, quiz, exams of 2 classes the same.</li>
</ul>
But wait - there's more. This class is totally free!
As a result, there have 160K students from every corner of globe enrolled in this class. That's amazing!
<h1>How was the class going?</h1>
<strong>Lessons is delivered by videos</strong>

<strong></strong>The videos is not captured in class room with blackboard, but with some piece of papers with professor's hand writing. A popular alternative is using software like KhanAcademy. However, I think, professors want to try new experiment this time.

Paper and handwriting style made us feel more friendly, but sometime inconvenient to see all text in the paper.

<strong>Collaboration with others</strong>

<strong></strong>We use a subreddit and aiqus.com to discuss. People in class are so passionate in helping others. The people there are brilliant and friendly. Many of them are very good at Maths and Probability, that helps me a lot when learning. They challenge every assumption in each quiz and exams, bring a deep explanation, and sometimes, point out mistakes of professors.

Having a huge number of classmate is so cool. Besides giving excellent discussions, many shared their own notes about class. It's <a href="http://larvecode.tumblr.com/post/11396980511" target="_blank">terrific</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/aiclass/comments/nfqso/my_evernotes_from_the_class/" target="_blank">inspired</a>. To help others scan or search through all video content, a guy build scripts to put all <a href="http://wonderwhy-er.com/ai-class/" target="_blank">video lectures side by side with captions</a>. His work is also great help for non-English speaker students. Another guy build script to help people bulk download lectures from YouTube.
<h2>Experience joyful moments</h2>
It's not only the knowledge, the class also bring many amusing moments.
The most joyful moment is when watching Sebastian telling his <strong>story about the auto-driving cars</strong>. Many of students watch this lecture again and again, feel inspired!

- The website <strong>ai-class.com was down</strong> few hours before almost every homework assignment's deadline. As a result, almost all homework assignment's deadlines were extended one more day. This is caused by a huge number of students wait until deadline to learn material and do their homework. Sometimes, people double that there had DDOS attack to cheat on homework's deadline!

- Many student shared about their learning. Here is the place, if you want to collect stories.  How old are student involve in this class? The answer will be surprising, many of them are over 80 years old! <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/01/23/udacity-and-the-future-of-online-universities/" target="_blank">More stories told by Sebastian</a>: "There were students in Afghanistan, exfiltrating war zones to grab an hour of connectivity to finish the homework assignments. There were single mothers keeping the faith and staying with the course even as their families were being hit by tragedy"

The class ended up very interesting and inspiring. My big <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/aiclass/comments/nj71v/the_class_is_ended_time_to_express_my_big_thanks/">thank for the class</a>:
<blockquote>to ours highly enthusiastic professors and organizing partners, to such great classmates (age in maybe 15+ up to 81+ :), and our discussions in reddit and aiqus. Thanks for many amusing moments. This class definitely hands me eagerness and tools to work on a real AI problems. Big thanks to all of you!</blockquote>
