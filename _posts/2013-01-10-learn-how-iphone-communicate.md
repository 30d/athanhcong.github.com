Long time ago, I asked myself how many sensors iPhone has? I could list unsurely a fews, but asking for the total, I don't know. Later, to chill down my curiousity, I checked the information, but today, ask me again, I'm still uncertain.



So the answer is iPhone has [5 sensors](http://ipod.about.com/od/ipodiphonehardwareterms/qt/iphone-sensors.htm): Proximity sensor, Motion sensor, Ambient Light sensor, Moisture sensor, iPhone 4 Gyroscope


In my world, I see "sensors" as a larger concept: includes every means that the phone can get data, or communicate with external environment. Camera, Touch Screen, Microphone, and Bluetooth, Wifi, GPS, GSM, also Internet, and even iOS _(provide us real Date Time, Time Interval data)_



**Why I want to learn this?**



Because, I was so fascinated about how people do things with the iPhone:

The Misfit Shine: Put device on the iPhone screen to transfer data, no wire, no cable, no pair.

Long before that, I love how Square, a credit card reader communicate with iPhone, by utilise the 3.5" audio jack. Ask me how to do it? I'm still not sure.

Or how Bump can help people share business card so easily. Both of you hold the phone on hands and hit the other hand. Very friendly, and simple. This is done by all software, no need an additional hardware.

And like Alan Kay said: **"people who are really serious about software should make their own hardware"**.

I write iPhone software for years, time for learning a bit about its hardware, too.

And I believe that understanding how the iPhone really communicates with our world, will help to write a much better software than I do right now: focusing mainly only on the Touch Screen sensor.
