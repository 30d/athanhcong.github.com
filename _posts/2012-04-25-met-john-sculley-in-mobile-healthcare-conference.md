Yes,<strong> John Sculley, the famous person who fired Steve Jobs.</strong> To me, it's really exciting to hear from this man. If you ever read biography of Steve Jobs, you will know that John had a long time as mentor of Steve Jobs. So John himself must have his own great thing that Steve Jobs wanted to learn too.

The conference is hold by Misfit Wearables, a new company who design next generation hardware for healthcare in US. Their co-founder is Sonny Vu, it's great that he is Vietnamese and he's successful in Silicon Valley. John backs this new company, he is a co-founder too. That's why we have him here in Vietnam.

The conference ran really well, I especially impressed with the MC, her questions are really smart to me. They don't give us chance to ask John directly, but her question just covered all the things flying in my mind: <strong>mobile healthcare, why in Vietnam, mentor of Steve Jobs, what John thinks is great about Steve Jobs's characteristics...</strong>

We talked about John and what he and Sonny is doing: mobile healthcare. It's great for me to know what others are doing on and why they are doing it.

<strong>The next big thing will be in Vietnam?</strong> Really, haha?

<strong>So what is the next big thing?</strong> It can be another iDevice. Hmm, maybe, we got many revolutions from Apple: Macintosh, Macbook Air, iPhone, iPad. Do we want another smart phone or tablet that we'll carry everyday? John and Sonny talk about next big thing on their vision. Their point is next revolutions will be Wearable Technology, with the combine of  natural-to-use, but sophisticate sensor (new way of Human Natural Interaction) and great computing in clouds. They use it to solve one of the most important problem right now: healthcare.

<strong>Why healthcare?</strong> Because healthcare is important for all of us and it costs so much of our money, especially in US. Sonny gives some key points to tell that mobile healthcare is great market <em>(I will check these information later on)</em>
<ul>
	<li>Mass market. Everyone does care.</li>
	<li>People pay for it. A lot (!). Last year, healthcare costs grows 9%, which is higher than GDP grows</li>
	<li>Great values: 2.6 trillions US Dollars. In 2020, it can be 20% of US GDP, wow!</li>
	<li>Not so much people are working on it.</li>
</ul>
And<strong> why they want to solve healthcare problem on *wearable device*?</strong> Their goal is to reduce healthcare cost. They develop better sensors, which can detect your body's condition, and use cloud computing to extract useful information for your health's status

<strong>Why it is low cost?</strong> Technology will help. Healthcare already missed the revolution of Internet, and Mobile. This time, cloud computing and wearables sensor technology will hit it.  Sonny used to work on a device that measures your blood's sugar. He has great experience on <strong>combine technology and healthcare</strong> on a great product, and bring it to the mass with lower cost.

My understanding: the reason why this is low cost is all about <em>you can know yourself healthy status</em>. I remember there has an advice in healthcare: <em>It's really important to discover your illness soon. There has a G-point of illness, if your body is not cured by then, it will be too late for you.</em> No matter how much money you have! The sooner you fix the wrong thing, the less cost you have to pay. So new technology will be you personal expert, who will help you diagnostic your illness soon. This is the key!

Another great thing, they shared is, in US your healthcare device costs will be covered by your health insurance. So you can use Sonny's products without paying more. This makes thing go-crazy! If you have a really great product on healthcare, people will not hesitate to use it, because with them your product appears to be free. So smart, haha! <em>(Here I just share the idea, I need to check this fact anyway :)</em>

Okay, one next big thing, very promising. Need a conclusion? Ask your own passion or you will see, hehe.

So now, <strong>why in Vietnam?</strong> These things appears to happen in US, in common sense. The answer is in Sonny's vision, he thinks that Vietnamese has huge potential to be more successful, especially in Maths and Sciences.

"Vietnam has huge potential", "Saigon is growing really fast". These kind of arguments I heard so many times from foreigners. They all are here in Saigon to be part of this growing, this potentiality. I wonder how they can make next big things happen here. So I asked Sonny, <strong>what is his secret weapon?</strong> His answer is <em>they can find people</em>. In Silicon Valley, there has a pool of talents, but it's also hard to find great people there, especially to bring them great passion to work together on an idea.

John also gives his own idea on <strong>how</strong> to make next big thing happened here in Vietnam. He emphasize on <strong>culture and mentoring</strong>. He talked about building a new culture here, a culture that provides permission to fail, daring to take risk, thinking out of the box. Besides that, young Vietnamese need some mentoring. Mentor - not visionary, not management - as an advisor, who give you great comment, help you learn lessons when you fall, then bring you back to right way.

Besides a strong passion, having a mentor will back your future. It's not easy to find a great mentor, this is my long time dream, too.

<strong>John said he wished to have a mentor, too.</strong> He was a successful CEO of Pepsi before being CEO of Apple, <strong>why</strong> does this successful man want to have a mentor? It came from his famous story, he fired Steve Jobs. Is this his bigest failure?

If you ever read biography of Steve Jobs, you will know that John did not fire Steve Jobs. It's an internal decision to choose what best for the company in that situation. This decision led Steve Jobs lose his decisive role in company, and Steve considered to leave. Nobody could say this is good or bad for Apple. Steve learned so much in the next period of his life before coming back to Apple. To me, only history defines *good* things.

John considers this is his failure anyway. He failed to understand how important the founder's passion is? He failed to keep Apple a great vision. When he lost Steve Jobs, he failed to get Steve back. John did not try to talk with Steve and figure out a way to bring Steve back to the company. At this point, he wished he had a mentor.

John says Steve Jobs was genius in general and for <strong>hiring best people and learn from them.</strong> If you ask John what's great about Steve Jobs, John can tell you about <strong>Steve Jobs's methodology</strong>, which is "no compromise", "only best", "great taste on User eXperience", "always challenge people". John said Steve did it repeatedly all the time, some cases Steve failed too, but most of the time, it turned out great results.

John ended his talk by saying: Sometime failure is not failure. <strong>"The Journey is the Reward"</strong>. The more he thinks about it, the more he sees it as a great view of life.

It's hard not to get inspired by Steve Jobs or John Sculley. But after all of these inspiration, to me, the only way to be successful is "<em>keep your head down, and do actual work"</em>.
