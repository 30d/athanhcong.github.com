title: It's "right" time for a startup
tag: Meaning of Life, Startup

---

I long to start a startup, however for last few years, I chose paid jobs, for experience, for my living, and for any other reasons.

My significant try was more than one and a half year ago. I left my job and started to do somethings on my own. That time, something happened with my family, and following was the saddest period of my life. People who were beside me, know clearly what I'm talking about.



Eventually, I could finish some projects, CoolQuote - an iOS app to read inspiring quotes from Twitter and Breaktify (work with my friend, Hong) - a break reminder app that helps you get more productive.



But then, I found myself looking for a job again. 



Thing is okay for my job, however recently I decided that I'm going back to startup path. 



And more important, this time I WILL NOT LEAVE THIS STARTUP PATH AGAIN, although I know there have so much difficulties and risks ahead. It's fine, I will fight for what I believe.



Why? Because this path represents my purpose of life. A year and a half ago, I wrote about my definition about [meaning of life](http://kong.vn/y-nghia-cuoc-song-2/). To me everything has its own meaning, and everything I choose to do in my life, should help my life become more meaningful. There has many ways to have a meaningful life: to love, to teach, to inspire, and to build useful things... I chose to build things.



Since then, nothing changed, I still love to build things and want to make myself as much useful for everyone as possible.



So, does that mean, with a working job, I can not build useful things for people? Yes, we can, but we really need some harmony with what we do. We love to build things, but not all the things we build will be useful. It's even harder to build something that's great. So we need to choose, which one we can build great, which we can not. Yes, it need some harmony. So far, I haven't got it with my jobs. Blame me, I'm unlucky to find a suitable job :)



So that is **spiritual part**, for **emotional part**, forgive me to keep it myself. And I will tell about the **rational part** of the reasons why I'm so determined now.



I found that when I'm passionate about something, I can write code much better. My daily jobs is coding. Coding is not easy, it's super hard mentally that outsiders usually say it's boring, insiders say it's stressful. The best way to code is to code for love. Love it, get motivated and code will be better. In last 3 months, I can really confirm this.



I write code to build software, service that I hope people will use. To build a great service, I need to write great code, design great interface. Again, not everything you design is good, you need to choose what to do, what not to do.



Lastly is my **opportunity part**. Now I found my choice, I met what I want to do, it's meaningful as my definition and it will help others, help myself better.



Each part of me tell me it's time. I get to start!

Even if my next project is fail, I will try again, and will not leave.
