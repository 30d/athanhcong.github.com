**Les Miserables (2012)** - the movie - is showing in cinemar, that I recommend to watch. The story is great, the musical is so amazing, that make me search for [the musical concert version](http://youtu.be/Iz13cWUokOs) to watch it again today.

Furthermore, there has one more thing, that make me write about Les Miserables: I was so thrill how magnificent the stage is! You see, there has hundred of people in the stage. Each of them do different jobs, but somehow, they all match together in an amazing musical party. I had many WOW moment, I feel admire the director, who have the ability to incoporate such complex things.

I also realize is that, in this musical party, everyone has their talent and shine their own way. Normally in a performance, the main actor and actress will get all credit. Here in Les Miserables, everyone doing such a great job, that I apprecite everyone of the team. The total effect is so amazing that each person, although highly talent, can not create themself along. Here, the total is much greater than the sum of each parts.

That is the thing I realized, if you ever find something to fight for, to work with, remember to **stand for something larger than yourself**.

Build something large enough that you are proud to be part of it,
<small>not something, too small, that you want to take them all.</small>
