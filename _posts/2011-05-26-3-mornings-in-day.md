I'm lying to myself, hic :(


Morning is always my coolest moment, I feel sound, eager to get thing done. Great!

And along the day, I'm a little down after noon, and sometime being badly productive in the evening.

To improve the situation, I'm addicted to taking a 10-20 minutes nap at noon. This short nap effectively helps me regain my attentive and feeling better in the afternoon. In my previous working place, my friends and I often said "Good morning!" after a nap. Fun!


Something change in these days...


I start to take a second nap in the evening. After getting back from working office, I have dinner, a bath, then take a short sleep, think about good things for "next morning".  This is my third morning in the day, I keep telling myself that "hey man, this is morning, I have to do good". Feeling cool, again :)


I want to share this feeling, and hope that I can keep lying to myself like this for long...
