I've just went back from Web Wednesday, it was getting really fun there. Plan to join next events if you have chance.

We had a small team game, in which, do brainstorming for a next killer mobile app. You know mobile is getting really hot, haha. People just want to talk about it, especially after Instagram 1 billions deal.

So I just want to put my team idea here. Maybe someone will find it interesting and can work on it.

We talk about shopping, then how to make transaction with mobile phone as easy as with credit card.

Normally, you go to supermarket, you know that you will possibly stuck for a long time in checkout line. Sometime you don't want to go there, just because you don't want to wait.

Okay, what if we tell you go to your favorite supermarket, walk by product you like, take its picture, then just go home. Your stuff will be delivered to your home by us. Automatically, hehe, is it cool?

There has an agency like NhomMua.com, who you will register with, in order to use the service. There has a mobile app, which will send products' pictures to "NhomMua" automatically for you. There will have another agency, who work with "NhomMua" to deliver stuffs for you. Everyone gets a bit from the money you pay for products.

Supermarket will happy because you just shopping more. Taking picture is so easy, haha :D

You, now will be happy with you shopping without any deadly waiting :D
