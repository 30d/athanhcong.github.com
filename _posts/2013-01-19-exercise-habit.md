So this make my morning, hopefully make my day better also.
There month ago, I wrote this:

It was Sunday, and I was going to have a dumb day. It is because I got to bed late the night before. My typical weekend day at the time: wake up late, then start to surf web, then read read read. Somewhere at 2 or 3 PM, I suddently realize that I need to have lunch. I eat some, try to code a bit, surf web, read read readâ€¦

So bad, I decided to start a challenge: I need to build a habit, I need to do exercise more.

It's 98 days since I started to do more sport. I wrote 39 notes for it, which means I feel happy for at least 39 moments. 

And even more, if I keep trying, I can get this habit: doing exercise everyday.
